              Top quality work! Vitaly replaced 7 sections of fence and their
              posts and built two gates and their posts.. The new fence and
              gates are well-built, strong and good-looking. I can truly echo
              all of the positive comments made by the other reviewers. He is an
              honest hard working professional, who communicates well and is
              very conscientious. I appreciate that he gave the care to my
              project as if it was his own. I will hire him again and highly
              recommend him.

              It was great working with Vitaly. He is professional, courteous,
              skillful, and was always on time. He takes pride in his work, is
              very conscientious, and has a high integrity. He explained the
              work in detail and kept the work area clean. He completed a number
              of projects for me, and I was completely satisfied with the
              result. I would highly recommend him to anyone.

              Really really happy with VY Construction’s work. We had dry rot on
              our siding and window trim. They were prompt to do an estimate and
              prompt to do the work. Crew was amazing — cleanup was spotless.
              Quality of the work was excellent. I’d definitely recommend this
              company!

              Several projects in the last two years - dual pane window
              replacement, siding replacement, rain gutter cleaning & covering,
              balcony support & decking repair/replacement. All projects
              completed on time, on quote, with professional care and all
              completed while exceeding my expectations. I highly recommend
              asking VY Construction to look at your construction project!

              VY construction has completed several projects for my home, and I
              hired them as well for projects at my father&apos;s house.
              Projects included repairing or replacing damaged home exterior
              features due to dry rot and weathering, new door installation,
              balcony repair, window replacement with leak mitigation, and
              decking. Their quality is the best from beginning to end. We
              received clear quotes, clean and easy to understand contracts, and
              good communication from the inception through the end of the
              projects. They showed up when scheduled, and if weather or delayed
              parts interfered with timing, VY Construction was on it
              immediately with a solution. I never worried that they
              wouldn&apos;t finish a job, or not show up, or any of the other
              types of complaints you might hear about in this industry. The VY
              team is highly skilled and professional, their work is solid and
              high quality, and they left the job site pristine when the
              projects were finished. Their pricing is appropriate for a high
              quality professional; you get what you pay for and if I could give
              10 stars to VY Construction, I would! I highly recommend VY
              Construction.
